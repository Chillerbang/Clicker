classes are serialized then sent
Under Client.DataServerToClient.java for 
	server to client relations
	
	ID // controls ID of local game instance
		if negative something weird happened
	EneID // controls ID of opponent game instance
		if negative no opponent
	GameOver // controls Game operation
		boolean to display end screen
	scoreLocal // score for local client
		if negative local has not to be sent new values 
	scoreEnenmy // score of opponent
		if negative no opponent found 
	CTS // storage of initial class used to create and ID client
		if null game client is not ready
		if islose is true client lost
		
				NB Client.DataServerToClient.java can modify Server.ClientToServer.java for control
					emulates response to commands
